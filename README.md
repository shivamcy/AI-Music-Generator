# 🎵 AI Music Generator 🎶  
> Generate AI-powered music using deep learning and MIDI sequences!  

## 📌 Overview  
AI Music Generator is a deep learning project that creates music using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The model is trained on MIDI files, learns musical patterns, and generates new sequences of notes to compose unique melodies.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **MIDI File Processing** – Converts MIDI files into note sequences  
✅ **LSTM-based Music Generation** – Learns from training data and generates music  
✅ **Custom Sequence Length** – Define how long the generated music should be  
✅ **MIDI File Output** – Saves generated music as a MIDI file  

## 📂 Project Structure

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup  

### **🔹 1. Clone the Repository**  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/shivamcy/AI-Music-Generator.git
cd AI-Music-Generator
```

### **🔹 2. Create a Virtual Environment**  
```sh
python -m venv music_env
source music_env/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
music_env\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

### **🔹 3. Install Dependencies**  
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **🔹 4. Prepare the Dataset**  
- Place your MIDI files in the `dataset/` folder  
- Run the preprocessing script:  
  ```sh
  python preprocess.py
  ```

### **🔹 5. Train the Model**  
```sh
python train.py
```
This will generate a trained model (`music_generator.h5`) in the `models/` folder.  

### **🔹 6. Generate Music**  
```sh
python generate_music.py
```
The generated MIDI file will be saved in `generated_music/output.mid`.

## 🧠 How It Works  
1. **Preprocessing**: Extracts note sequences from MIDI files.  
2. **Training**: LSTM model learns patterns from the note sequences.  
3. **Generation**: The trained model predicts the next note based on previous ones.
